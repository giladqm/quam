## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added InOutSingleChannel
- Add optional `config_settings` property to quam components indicating that they should be called before/after other components when generating QUA configuration

### Changed
- Changed `InOutIQChannel.input_offset_I/Q` to `InOutIQChannel.opx_input_offset_I/Q`
- Renamed `SingleChannel.output_offset` -> `SingleChannel.opx_output_offset`
- Pulse behaviour modifications to allow pulses to be attached to objects other than channels. Changes conist of following components
  - Added `pulse.channel`, which returns None if both its parent & grandparent is not a `Channel`
  - Rename `Pulse.full_name` -> `Pulse.name`.
    Raises error if `Pulse.channel` is None
    TODO Check if this causes issues
  - `Pulse.apply_to_config` does nothing if pulse has no channel

### Fixed
- Don't raise instantiation error when required_type is not a class

## [0.2.2] -
### Added
- Overwriting a reference now raises an error. A referencing attribute must first be set to None

## [0.2.1] -
This release primarily targets Octave compatibility
### Changes
